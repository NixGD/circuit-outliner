# circuit-outliner

A basic implementaiton of using SGD over [path-patching hypotheses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05969) to automatically localize behaviors. Inspired by work I did while at Redwood.

This is very much a work in progress! I hope to have a markdown file that more clearly summarizes current results soon. In the meantime, I reccomend looking at [this file](https://github.com/NixGD/circuit-outliner/blob/main/outliner/run.py) for the best summary.

## TODO:
- Finish basic implimentation
- Sanity checks + naive experiments
- Allow hypotheses about direct paths direct paths to the output.
