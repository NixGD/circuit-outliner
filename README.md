# circuit-outliner

A basic implementaiton of using SGD over path-patching hypotheses to automatically localize behaviors. Inspired by work I did while at Redwood.

(more explantation will be added later)

## TODO:
- Finish basic implimentation
- Sanity checks + naive experiments
- Allow hypotheses about direct paths direct paths to the output.
